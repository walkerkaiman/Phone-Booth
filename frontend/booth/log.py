"""
frontend/booth/log.py
=====================
High-level role:
- Centralized logging setup for the booth application.

Where this fits:
- Called by `main.py` on startup; other modules import a helper to get a logger.

What this file typically contains (when implemented):
- A `configure_logging(level: str)` function to set up console logging.
- A `get_logger(name: str)` convenience.
