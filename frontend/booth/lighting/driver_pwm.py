"""
frontend/booth/lighting/driver_pwm.py
====================================
High-level role:
- A GPIO PWM-based lighting driver for platforms like Raspberry Pi.

Where this fits:
- Selected by config when `lighting.driver` is "pwm" and hardware is available.

What this file typically contains (when implemented):
- A `PWMLightingDriver` that sets up a PWM channel on the configured GPIO pin and maps
  brightness (0â€“255) to a duty cycle.

Notes for new contributors:
- Keep GPIO access isolated here; detect platform and handle missing libs gracefully.
