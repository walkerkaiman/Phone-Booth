"""
backend/app/log.py
==================
High-level role:
- Provides centralized logging configuration for the backend.
- Supports plain-text or JSON-formatted logs depending on configuration.

Where this fits:
- Called by `main.py` very early during app startup to configure log handlers.
- Other modules import the configured logger or call a `get_logger(name)` helper.

What this file typically contains (when implemented):
- A function like `configure_logging(level: str, json: bool)` that sets up `logging`.
- Optional dependency on `uvicorn`/`gunicorn` loggers to standardize output.
- A helper `get_logger(__name__)` to fetch named loggers consistently.

Notes for new contributors:
- Prefer structured logs (JSON) in production for easier ingestion.
- Keep log levels conservative (INFO) by default, DEBUG behind a flag.
